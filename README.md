Great! Each playlist has a certain requirements

### Entry format  

If you would like to submit a song or album, it should follow this format. You are welcome to add your name to your submission, but it is not necessary.

Title  
Album | Artist // Name of Submitter

Only the title needs the hyperlink to the song, which in markdown should look like  

```
[Title](url)  
Album | Artist // Name of Submitter
```

Most of the playlists will follow this or a similar format.

### Main playlist
The [Main playlist](playlist.md) has categories. First find one that suits your song, if there is none then you can either put your song in the "Not Categorized" category or make a new category. 

### Alphabetical 
This playlist is pretty self-explanatory.

### With views
When adding the view count, add it after the artist. Get the view count from youtube.

Title  
Album | Artist | X views
